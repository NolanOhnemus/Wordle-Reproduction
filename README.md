## Introduction

This project was a semester-long initiative developed using the Scrum methodology to recreate the New York Times game Wordle. Our team of four completed five 3-week sprints, successfully replicating the original game while incorporating our own creative touches. The project resulted in a fully functional application enabling users to play Wordle seamlessly.

In addition to recreating the core gameplay, we introduced new features such as statistic tracking and various quality-of-life improvements to enhance the original experience. The project was primarily developed using TypeScript and CSS within the React framework. It also relies on a MongoDB server to facilitate communication between the client and server, specifically querying words dynamically to prevent cheating.

This project served as both my introduction to JavaScript/TypeScript and CSS. My responsibilities included developing the statistics manager, contributing to the core game logic, and working on the CSS styling. I also created animations and ensured the visual design was a faithful, one-to-one recreation of the original Wordle.

## Installation Instructions

Our implementation of the Wordle game was dependent on a MongoDB database, which is unfortunately no longer available. As a result, the game cannot currently be executed. However, if a replacement database were provided, the following instructions could be used to start the server and client, enabling the game to be played.

In separate terminals, use the following commands to run the application:
- npm run start
- npm run server
