# Wordle Reproduction

## Overview

This project was a semester-long initiative developed using the Scrum methodology to recreate the New York Times game Wordle. Our team of four completed five 3-week sprints, successfully replicating the original game while incorporating our own creative touches. The project resulted in a fully functional application enabling users to play Wordle seamlessly.

In addition to recreating the core gameplay, we introduced new features such as statistic tracking and various quality-of-life improvements to enhance the original experience. The project was primarily developed using TypeScript and CSS within the React framework. It also relies on a MongoDB server to facilitate communication between the client and server, specifically querying words dynamically to prevent cheating.

This project provided a comprehensive introduction to TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS, while deepening my understanding of full-stack development with React and MongoDB. I developed the statistics manager, contributed to the core gameplay logic, and crafted CSS animations to ensure a visually faithful recreation of the original Wordle. Working within an Agile Scrum framework over five sprints, I gained experience in collaborative software development, sprint planning, and iterative problem-solving.

## Objective

The goal is to create a responsive, intuitive Wordle-inspired interface that mirrors the original game's logic and user experience while practicing robust UIâ€“backend integration using contemporary web technologies and team-driven development workflows.

## Key Features

- **Agile Development Workflow**: Built following Scrum methodology across 3-week sprints.
- **Interactive Web Client**:
  - Built with React and TypeScript
  - Engaging word-guessing mechanics and interactive feedback
- **Backend Logic**:
  - Node.js server handles game logic and request processing

## Application Flow

1. Run the frontend in one terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
2. Launch the backend in another:
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
3. The frontend provides an accessible interface for the player to submit guesses, with visual feedback reflecting correct, present, or absent letters.

## Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, modern state management
- **Backend**: Node.js, API routing via npm scripts
- **Development Workflow**: Scrum, collaborative planning via User Stories
